## Team Charter

### Purpose
We, the members of team 05, establish this charter to define our agreed-upon methods of work, communication, and conflict resolution. This document serves to protect and support all members by clarifying expectations and providing processes for accountability and restoration when needed.

---

## 1. How Work Will Flow
1. **Task Assignment & Planning**  
   - All tasks will be identified and tracked via Basecamp.  
   - Each task will have a clear owner and defined deliverables.  
   - Sprint or iteration planning meetings will be held Weekly on Mondays to assign tasks and set goals.

2. **Collaboration & Reviews**  
   - Team members will collaborate through feature branches and submit pull requests (PRs) for review.    

3. **Deadlines & Milestones**  
   - Milestones and deadlines will be proposed by task owners and agreed upon by the team and affirmed by the Project manager.  
   - If circumstances arise that impact deadlines, the team member responsible will communicate changes as soon as possible.

---

## 2. Communication Rules and Methods
1. **Primary Communication Channel**  
   - The primary channel for real-time communication will be Discord.
   - Team members will check messages at least once per working day.

2. **Email & Asynchronous Updates**  
   - Formal or high-level communications will be sent via email and Discord.  
   - Everyone is expected to respond to emails requiring input within 48 hours.

3. **Meetings**  
   - Weekly team check-ins will be held Monday, during lab.  
   - Additional ad-hoc meetings will be scheduled as needed, ensuring availability of all relevant members.

## 3. Consequences
1. **Missed Deadlines Without Communication**  
   - First occurrence: A direct conversation to understand challenges and offer support.  
   - Second occurrence: A documented warning outlining missed responsibilities and agreed-upon corrective actions.

2. **Lack of Participation**  
   - Team members who do not participate in meetings or fail to contribute deliverables repeatedly will receive a formal request to recommit.  
   - Continuous non-participation may lead to further actions, including escalation to the course instructor or removal from the team, if permitted by organizational or academic guidelines.

3. **Unprofessional Conduct**  
   - Offensive or disruptive communication or behavior will not be tolerated.  
   - Any such conduct will be documented, and the team will address it directly. If unresolved, it may lead to immediate intervention by a mediator or higher authority.

---

## 4. Restoration Methods
1. **Open Dialogue**  
   - Team members are encouraged to seek resolution through constructive discussion.  
   - If a conflict arises, the involved parties will schedule a conversation with the teamâ€™s chosen mediator or project lead.

2. **Mediation and Support**  
   - Should direct communication fail, a neutral third party (The Instructor or  TA) will facilitate a resolution session.  
   - The focus will be on identifying the root cause of conflicts and finding a mutually agreeable path forward.

3. **Rebuilding Trust**  
   - After conflicts are resolved or accountability measures are completed, team members will reaffirm their commitment to the charter.  
   - This may include re-establishing communication norms, adjusting tasks, or drafting a personalized improvement plan.
