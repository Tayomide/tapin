## The IdeaShop TapIn System:
Our goal with this project is to create a Tap in system for the Ideashop in Kaplan. Students will tap their IDs, this will query a database to check for their safety trainings and validate entry to the shop. Our scope will aim to provide a proof of concept that will hopefully be integrated with the IIT API for ID systems in the future.
